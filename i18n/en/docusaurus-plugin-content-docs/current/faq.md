# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is Q-Control Nova?
Q-Control Nova is a 3U quantum control module that integrates cryo-CMOS electronics, silicon optical links, and in-memory acceleration. It is designed for the control and error correction of up to 256 superconducting or spin qubits per unit.

### What advantages does Q-Control Nova offer compared to other systems?
The main advantages include:
- 95% reduction in cabling
- 80% decrease in energy consumption
- Low correction latency (less than 1 Âµs)
- Scalability for systems of more than one million qubits
- Integration with industry standard technologies

### What are the main use cases?
- High-performance quantum computing
- Research in quantum error correction
- Quantum algorithm development
- Complex scientific simulations
- Quantum cryptographic processing

## Architecture and Technology

### What are the main technologies used by the platform?
- Frontend: Angular with Tailwind CSS
- API Gateway: YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy)
- Microservices: .NET 10 (C#)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Messaging: RabbitMQ
- ORM: Dapper
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

### How is the microservices architecture structured?
The architecture consists of the following main microservices:
- UserSvc: User management and authentication
- ProductSvc: Product catalog management
- OrderSvc: Order processing
- NotificationSvc: Multi-channel notification system
- Payment Service: Payment processing

### Is it possible to horizontally scale the microservices?
Yes, all microservices are designed to scale horizontally. We use Docker containers and follow stateless design principles, which allows adding more instances as needed to handle additional loads.

## Implementation and Deployment

### What are the minimum requirements to deploy the platform?
- Hardware: Servers with minimum 16GB RAM, 4 vCPUs
- Software: Docker, Docker Compose or Kubernetes
- Storage: SSD for databases (minimum 100GB)
- Network: High-speed Internet connection (1Gbps recommended)

### How are microservices deployed?
Microservices are deployed as Docker containers, orchestrated using Kubernetes for production environments or Docker Compose for development. We use Blue/Green deployment strategies to minimize downtime during updates.

### How are updates and migrations managed?
Updates follow an automated CI/CD process with testing in staging environments before moving to production. Database migrations are handled through versioned scripts that are executed during deployment.

## Security

### What security measures does the platform implement?
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Role and policy-based authorization
- Protection against brute force attacks through rate limiting
- Encryption of sensitive data
- Input validation to prevent injections
- HTTPS/TLS for all communications

### How is confidential data protected?
Confidential data such as passwords are stored using secure hashing algorithms (like bcrypt). Sensitive personal information is encrypted before being stored in the database, and strict role-based access controls are implemented.

### Does the platform comply with regulations like GDPR?
Yes, the platform is designed considering regulations like GDPR, with features such as:
- Ability to export user data
- Functionality to permanently delete user data
- Detailed logging of activities related to personal data
- Explicit consent for data processing

## Observability and Maintenance

### What monitoring tools are integrated?
- Centralized logging with Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana
- Performance metrics with Prometheus and Grafana
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Automated alerts for critical conditions
- Customizable dashboards for different roles

### How are logs and errors managed?
Logs are centralized using an EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana). Errors are captured, logged with detailed context, and depending on their severity, generate alerts for the operations team. Each service implements circuit breakers to manage failures in dependent systems.

### Are there backup and recovery procedures?
Yes, daily backups are performed for all databases and critical configurations. Recovery procedures are documented and regularly tested, with defined recovery time objectives (RTO) for different failure scenarios.

## Integration and Development

### Is an API provided for integration with external systems?
Yes, all services expose RESTful APIs documented with Swagger/OpenAPI. Additionally, SDKs are provided for common languages such as JavaScript, Python, and C# to facilitate integration.

### How can I extend existing functionality?
The platform is designed to be extensible through:
- Documented extension points in each service
- Plugin system for specific functionalities
- Webhooks for real-time integrations
- Well-documented public APIs

### What development environment is recommended?
We recommend:
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with extensions for .NET and Angular
- Docker Desktop for local containers
- Git for version control
- Postman or similar for API testing
- Node.js for frontend development

## Performance and Scalability

### How many concurrent users can the platform handle?
In a standard configuration, the platform can handle up to 10,000 concurrent users. With appropriate horizontal scaling, this number can increase significantly according to needs.

### How is resilience to failures handled?
We implement resilience patterns such as:
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures
- Retry policies with exponential backoff
- Bulkheads to isolate failed components
- Health checks for early problem detection
- Fallback strategies for critical functionalities

### What caching strategies are used to improve performance?
- Distributed cache with Redis
- In-memory cache for reference data
- CDN for static frontend assets
- HTTP cache with event-based invalidation
- Optimized caching strategies by service
